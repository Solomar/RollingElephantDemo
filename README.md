## Unity To Godot Example Projects for the Global Game Jam site "Let's Play! Tokyo"

Using an old unfinished game jam I made in Unity, I ported what I had to Godot. Hopefully it can highlight some of the similarities and differences approach you can use when coming from a Unity background. Or even if you're just starting with either of them.

There may very well be some bugs and questionable code in the mix since the nature of the original project was a short game jam.

Unity version used: 2022.2.4f1
Godot version used: 4.2
